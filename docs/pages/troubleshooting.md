# Troubleshooting

## Cannot Open Elaina

Make sure you are running Java SE Version 11 or above. You can check your Java version in a terminal as follows:

```bash
$ java --version
java 11.0.9 2020-10-20 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.9+7-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.9+7-LTS, mixed mode)
```

## Links Do Not Work

If you are running Elaina on Linux, it is possible that your system is missing some libraries required. Try installing `libgnome` and see if the problem is solved.
